This project is abondoned. The purpose of thync was to combine a movie link with an audio dub link and save their sync'd up play times. The web player would then automatically keep in sync when pausing, fast forwarding, etc. Turns out most movie hosting sites use ephemeral links which means shared thync links only function for a few hours.
